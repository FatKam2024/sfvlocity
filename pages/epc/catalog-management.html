                <li><strong>Time-Based Catalog Management:</strong> Implement catalogs that automatically update based on time factors, such as promotional periods or product lifecycle stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Approval Workflows:</strong> Set up approval processes for catalog changes to ensure proper review and compliance before updates go live.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Ensure proper integration between your catalogs and other systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) for consistent product information across the organization.</li>
                <li>Provide thorough training to sales and customer service teams on how to effectively use and navigate the catalogs.</li>
            </ul>
