            <h3>Lab: Setting Up Pricing Rules</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to the pricing section in EPC.</li>
                <li>Create a new pricing rule:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Name the rule (e.g., "Volume Discount for Enterprise Customers")</li>
                        <li>Select the applicable products or product groups</li>
                        <li>Define the conditions (e.g., customer type = 'Enterprise' AND quantity > 100)</li>
                        <li>Set the pricing action (e.g., apply 15% discount)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Set up a tiered pricing structure:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create multiple tiers based on quantity ranges</li>
                        <li>Assign discount percentages or fixed prices to each tier</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Implement a time-based promotional discount:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Set up a rule with a specific date range</li>
                        <li>Define the promotional pricing or discount</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Create a bundle pricing rule:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Select the products that form the bundle</li>
                        <li>Define the bundle price or discount</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Test the pricing rules by simulating various sales scenarios:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try different customer types, quantities, and product combinations</li>
                        <li>Verify that the correct prices and discounts are applied</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
